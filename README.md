# Income & Expense Tracker

This is a simple Python program that helps you keep track of how much money you earn and how much you spend. You just enter each income or expense with a category—like Food, Salary, Rent—and the program shows your total savings and visualizes your spending with charts.

## What It Does

- Lets you enter income and expenses
- Stores amount, category, and type of transaction
- Calculates:
  - Total income
  - Total expense
  - Net balance (how much money you're left with)
- Shows charts to help you understand your money better:
  - *Bar chart* (Income vs Expense)
  - *Pie chart* (Where your money is spent)
